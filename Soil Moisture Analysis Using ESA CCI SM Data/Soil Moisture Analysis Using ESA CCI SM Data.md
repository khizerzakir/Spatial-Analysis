# Soil Moisture Analysis Using ESA CCI SM Data

## Overview
This analysis explores soil moisture data using ESA CCI SM (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture) datasets. The primary goal is to understand soil moisture variability over time and space, with a focus on the Iberian Peninsula and the D-A-CH (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) regions. Key outputs include temporal and spatial trends in soil moisture, as well as seasonal and annual summaries.

## Key Outputs

### 1. Regional Mean Soil Moisture Time Series

- **Description**: This plot shows the temporal variability of soil moisture from January 2021 to January 2022 for the Iberian Peninsula (blue) and the D-A-CH region (green).
- **Key Insights**:
  - Soil moisture in the D-A-CH region is generally higher compared to the Iberian Peninsula.
  - Significant fluctuations in soil moisture are observed, reflecting seasonal variations and climatic influences.

### 2. Seasonal Soil Moisture Content Maps

- **Description**: These maps provide a global view of soil moisture content for each season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) in 2021.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Soil moisture peaks in certain regions during specific seasons, e.g., high moisture levels in the tropics during winter (DJF).
  - Seasonal variations are prominent, particularly in temperate and arid zones.

### 3. Annual Mean Soil Moisture Maps for Iberia and D-A-CH

- **Description**: Annual mean soil moisture maps for 2021 focus on Iberia and the D-A-CH regions.
- **Key Insights**:
  - The Iberian Peninsula exhibits lower soil moisture overall, with notable dryness in southern areas.
  - The D-A-CH region displays a more uniform distribution with moderate to high soil moisture.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: ESA CCI SM data was utilized, providing high-resolution soil moisture measurements.
- **Tools Used**: Python was employed for data processing and visualization, leveraging libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `cartopy`.
- **Analysis Steps**:
  1. Data preprocessing and selection of regions of interest (Iberia, D-A-CH).
  2. Computation of mean soil moisture values over time and space.
  3. Seasonal and annual aggregation for spatial visualization.

## Implications
Understanding soil moisture dynamics is crucial for:
- **Agricultural Planning**: Efficient irrigation and crop management.
- **Hydrological Modeling**: Enhanced prediction of floods and droughts.
- **Climate Research**: Insights into regional impacts of climate variability.
